CUB3D

A Java-based 3D graphics & modeling engine I wrote back in college. It features:
 • Isometric and pseudo-perspective camera modes
 • Wireframe and solid fill modes
 • Basic polygon/object grouping

HOW TO RUN

Launch "CUB3D 0.2.5.jar". Click "Load" and select a file to load from the "data" directory. NOTE: Some files may take longer to load than others, so be patient! A good place to start is "cubes.stl".

CONTROLS

Rotate camera = Click + Drag
Zoom in/out = Scroll up/down
Move camera = Shift Click + Drag
